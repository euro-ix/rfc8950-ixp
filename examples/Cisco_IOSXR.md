# Cisco IOS XR

## Minimum Software Version

Presumably minimum version is IOS-XR 7.3.3 ([3rd-party source](https://www.ausnog.net/sites/default/files/ausnog-2022/presentations/ausnog_2022-day2-07-cooper_lees-who_needs_arp_v4_via_v6.pdf)).

## Configuration

```
interface GigabitEthernet 0/1/1
  ipv4 forwarding-enable
  ipv6 address 2001:db8:1::1/126

router bgp 64500
    bgp router-id 192.0.1.1
    address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 2001:db8:1::2
        remote-as 64496
        description Example
        enforce-first-as
        address-family ipv4 unicast
            maximum-prefix 5 95
            send-community-ebgp
            route-policy session-as64496-v4-in in
            route-policy session-as64496-v4-out out
            send-extended-community-ebgp
            next-hop-self
            remove-private-AS
            soft-reconfiguration inbound always
        !
        address-family ipv6 unicast
            maximum-prefix 5 95
            send-community-ebgp
            route-policy session-as41731-v6-in in
            route-policy session-as41731-v6-out out
            send-extended-community-ebgp
            remove-private-AS
            soft-reconfiguration inbound always
  !
 !
!
```

Important lines are:

1. `next-hop-self` - this is not default in this case!
2. `ipv4 forwarding-enable` - to allow forwarding of IPv4 packets on IPv6-only interfaces. Otherwise they will be silently dropped.
3. `address-family ipv4 unicast` - otherwise the neighbors will fail to be activated, even if no networks are configured to be exported.

## Testing

### Are prefixes received?

Example:

```
# show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbors 2001:db8:1::2 received routes

   Network            Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
*  192.0.2.0/24      2001:db8:1::2
                                                             0 64496 i

```

### Is the next-hop address resolution working?

```
#sho ip route 192.0.2.0/24
